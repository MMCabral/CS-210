# CS-210

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The intention of this project was to create two functioning and updateable clocks with local time. 
  By doing so I created a program that clients could adjust the clocks of a website to their time zone 
  one which was in 24 hour time and the other with 12 hour time format.
#What did you do particularly well?
  In the project I created a functioning interactable menu which has built in error handling functions.
  I used a switch funtion within a while loop to keep the menu running until the user wants to quit the program.
#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could enhance my code by created a function for my menu so I could reduce the amount of code within the main file.
  With creating its own function I could just simply call the menu inside my main file and that would greatly reduce the amount of code to run through.
#Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I found creating the two clocks very challanging, for a long time I could not figure out how to have
  both clocks on display at the same time until I figured putting both into one function instead of two would make that reality possible.
  I spent countless hours looking through our material until that idea dawned on me and by doing so I 
  saved myself from writing redundant code.
#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  I believe the skill of being able to call the local time from a computer will be usefull in the future.
  Just being able to interact with the computer in different ways I think will help me for future classes.
#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made this project readable by using variables that are named after the function I want them to complete
  and by adding inline comments to support their functionality.
  I made it adaptable by explaining my goal within the code with comments so any programmer who looks at it in
  the future will know exactly my thought process.
  I made my code maintainable by making multiple functions for each part of the code instead of writing it all under the main function.
